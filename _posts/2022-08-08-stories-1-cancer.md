Last week I watched a video about a streamer/Youtuber who was gone because of cancer when he was 22 and in his 
prime of career. He had been a jovial person with an upbeat personality til the last days of his life.
But a lot of terminal cancer patients I know did not have that positive thinking.

They tended to lose their optimism and gave in to discouragement and self-pity. 
The true that you might only live up to few months can knock you out whether you're rich or poor, old or young. 
Sometime I wonder what I would do if it were me. That's terrible!

I also noticed the way the family and friends treated that patients, looked after both their physical and emotional needs.
Seeing people are dying by cancer is terrible experience - but rather than that, such experiences taught me to value 
family more and to be kind to others.

...I once heard someone say:

***"If you die of cancer, the cancer also die. So it's a draw"***

*No one is defeated by cancer.*
